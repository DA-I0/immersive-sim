### Overview
Proof of concept for a first-person immersive sim sandbox game.

### Features
- Basic movement with smooth speed control. 
- Stance system with classic and smooth stance/lean control.
- Health and stamina system.
- Inventory system.
- Usable items (clothes, books, consumables).
- Item placement (and hanging when appropriate).
- Dialogue system.
- Item shop system.
- Open world with async sub-level streaming.
- Interactable props (vending machines, benches, doors).
- Device power states (electronic devices like vending machines have to be connected to a power socket, player interactable cable).
- Basic NPCs with placeholder dialogue, navigation and point-of-interest interactions.
- Very simple "job system" (find a job posting, talk to a potential employer, "work" with appropriate time skip and stamina hit, salary gain).
- Save/load system.
- Time and date system.
- Customisable user settings (UI, graphics, audio, controls)

### TODO
